## 2.25.0 (2015-08-02)
### Changes

Significant performance improvement for handling of apps with logging disabled.  Any apps with logging disabled will now have zero cpu/battery impact.

If you like to use Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, or any other high-traffic app while NetworkLog is enabled, but don't want to drain your battery with logging, just disable logging for that app.
